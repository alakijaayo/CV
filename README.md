Degree educated graduate with good communication skills: focused, IT literate and willing to learn, with a background in sales, marketing, administration and relationship management. Having grown interested in the world of Web and Application development, I embarked on learning and understanding the use of code and the languages used to help build my knowledge with the aim of becoming a Junior Developer.

After completing the 12 week course at Makers Academy, am looking to fully utilise the skills I have learnt on the course and in past job roles to join a team of experienced developers where I can grow as part of a team and develop my skills further. Self-motivated and experienced with time-dependent tasks, data collection and working within a team.

Tech Skills: Ruby, JavaScript, Swift, ReactJS, Rails, NodeJS

## Skills

#### Communication Skills

During my time with Groupon, I spent my time speaking to new prospective clients who were looking to join the platform, as well as speaking to existing clients and maintaining the relationship that I had built with them, dealing with any issues they had with deals on the platform and discussing new deals with them.

My time at Kings also allowed me to be in constant communication with patients who were currently waiting for their surgery. It was my duty to keep them informed of when their surgery was booked or cancelled, as well as making sure they attended any appointments before surgery.

My written communication skills have been developed by me blogging about my experince learning code and using it to describe my learning processes in Swift and other languages, allowing me to build a bigger online presence.

#### Team Player

Have worked in a team surrounding at all work places, most notably at Kings where myself and three others handled the diaries and schedule of the Opthamology surgeons, booking in patients as well as rescheduling them if emergencies needed to be booked in.

At Groupon, worked in a team dealing with enquiries from clients looking to join Groupon and bring them onto the platform. Have also worked in a group on my final [project](https://github.com/alakijaayo/Radioroom), helping to build our project in 10 days by learning new languages and how to test using new frameworks such as Cypress.io

#### Negotiation

Once key skill I was taught working with Groupon was learning to negotiate and build a deal with new and existing clients. This involved building a deal that was suitable not only for the client but for the platform, negotiating price of the voucher, percentage the client would receive from each sale and amount of vouchers that would be available to customers on the platform.
