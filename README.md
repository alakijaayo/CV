Degree-educated graduate with good communication skills: focused, IT literate and willing to learn, with a background in sales, marketing, administration and relationship management. Having grown interested in Web and Application development, I embarked on learning and understanding the use of code and the languages used to help build my knowledge and become a developer.

I have over 5 years of work experience in the tech industry, mainly in the consulting space which has allowed me to work in numerous sectors and clients. I am looking to fully utilise the skills I have learnt in past job roles to join a team of developers where I can not only pass on my wealth of knowledge to the team but where I can grow and develop my skills further. I am self-motivated and experienced with time-dependent tasks, data collection and working within a team.

**Tech Skills:** Ruby, JavaScript, Typescript, Swift, ReactJS, ReactTS, Rails, NodeJS, NextTS 

## Skills

#### Communication Skills

During my time with Groupon, I spent my time speaking to new prospective clients who were looking to join the platform, as well as speaking to existing clients and maintaining the relationship that I had built with them, dealing with any issues they had with deals on the platform and discussing new deals with them.

My time at King's allowed me to be in constant communication with patients who were currently waiting for their surgery. It was my duty to keep them informed of when their surgery was booked or cancelled, as well as to make sure they attended any appointments before surgery.

My written communication skills have been developed by blogging about my experience learning code and using it to describe my learning processes in Swift and other languages, allowing me to build a bigger online presence.

#### Team Player

Have been a key member of a BIMA award-winning team which created a loyalty application for Azzurri and their restaurant Zizzi, working on the project from its initial conception to its release, as well as working to maintain the application after release.

Have worked in a team surroundings at all workplaces, including Kings where I and three others handled the diaries and schedule of the Ophthalmology surgeons, booking in patients as well as rescheduling them if emergencies needed to be booked in.

At Groupon, worked in a team dealing with enquiries from clients looking to join Groupon and bring them onto the platform. Have also worked in a group on my final [project](https://github.com/alakijaayo/Radioroom), helping to build our project in 10 days by learning new languages and how to test using new frameworks such as Cypress.io

#### Negotiation

One key skill I was taught working with Groupon was how to negotiate and build a deal with new and existing clients. This involved building a deal suitable not only for the client but for the platform, negotiating the price of the voucher, the percentage the client would receive from each sale, and the number of vouchers available to customers on the platform.
