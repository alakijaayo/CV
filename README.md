## Ayodele Olabode Alakija

Degree Educated graduate with good communication skills: focused, IT literate and willing to learn, with a background in sales, marketing, administration and relationship management. Having grown interested in the world of Web and Application development, I embarked on learning and understanding the use of code and the languages used to help build my knowledge with the aim of becoming a Junior Developer and wanting to use this to enter the world of Software Development.

After completing the 12 week course at Makers Academy, am looking to fully utilise the skills I have learnt on the course and in past job roles to join a team of experienced developers where I can grow as part of a team and develop my skills further. Self-motivated and experienced with time-dependent tasks, data collection and working within a team.
